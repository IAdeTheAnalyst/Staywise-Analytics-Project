# 🏡 StayWise Analytics — Python Data Analytics Project  

StayWise Analytics is a Python-based data analytics project that explores **short-term rental markets** (similar to Airbnb) using **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.  
The project analyzes **host performance**, **guest reviews**, **pricing strategies**, and **market trends** to deliver clear, data-driven insights.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing multiple datasets, including:  
- **Listings dataset** — property details, host information, locations, and prices  
- **Reviews dataset** — guest ratings, review dates, and reviewer IDs  
- **Hosts dataset** — host tenure, location, and portfolio size

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Distribution of **listings by location, property type, and price range**  
- Impact of **host experience** (years since joining) on reviews and performance  
- Seasonal trends in **reviews and booking activity**  
- Relationship between **pricing** and **guest ratings**  
- Identification of **top-performing hosts and neighborhoods**  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned  
- Cleaning and merging multiple CSV datasets efficiently using **pandas**  
- Performing groupby operations to calculate **KPIs** (e.g., avg ratings, occupancy potential, price ranges)  
- Creating clear visualizations with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**  
- Applying **data storytelling** to highlight hospitality insights  
- Building reproducible workflows for analytics projects  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis & visualization  
- **CSV datasets** (listings + reviews)
